# A Little Folk Tale - Project Status & Reference

## üéÆ Project Overview
**Game Type:** Top-down 3D Action-Adventure (Diablo meets Zelda meets Redwall)  
**Engine:** Unity 2022.3 LTS with Universal Render Pipeline (URP)  
**Target Platforms:** Nintendo Switch (primary), Steam Deck, PC  
**Repository:** https://github.com/Doug824/a_little_folk_tale.git

## üìä Current Development Status

### ‚úÖ Complete Unity Project Structure Created!

I've set up a comprehensive Unity project template for "A Little Folk Tale" with:

### üìÅ File Structure
- Organized folders for Art, Audio, Scripts, Prefabs, Scenes, etc.
- Separated project assets from external/third-party assets
- Clear hierarchy for different game systems

### üéÆ Core Systems
1. **GameManager** - Handles game state, scene loading, save/load
2. **PlayerController** - Full movement, combat, stamina system with controller support
3. **CameraController** - Fixed-angle follow camera (Diablo-style)
4. **DialogueSystem** - Branching dialogue with portraits and choices
5. **AudioManager** - Centralized audio handling for music, SFX, and ambient

### üéØ Input System
- Complete InputActions file configured for:
  - Controller-first design (Switch/Steam Deck layout)
  - Keyboard & Mouse fallback
  - Separate UI navigation actions

### üìù ScriptableObjects
- **ItemData** - For weapons, consumables, key items
- **DialogueData** - For conversation trees
- **EnemyData** - For enemy stats and behaviors

### üîß Additional Features
- Lantern save point system
- UI components (MainMenu with book animation)
- Package manifest with all required Unity packages
- Complete .gitignore for Unity projects
- Detailed SETUP_GUIDE.md

### üöÄ Ready to Use
This structure is production-ready and includes:
- Namespaces for code organization
- Interface-based interaction system
- Event-driven architecture where appropriate
- Comments for complex sections
- Proper null checking and error handling

### ‚úÖ NEW: Prototype Testing Framework Added!

**Code-First Development Setup:**
- **TestSceneSetup** - Automatically generates test environment with Unity primitives
- **DebugUI** - Real-time player stats monitoring (Health, Stamina, Position, Input)
- **Enhanced PlayerController** - Ready for immediate testing and iteration
- **TestScene.unity** - Complete test scene ready to run

**How to Test in Unity:**
1. Open Unity project with this folder structure
2. Load `Assets/_Project/Scenes/TestScene.unity`
3. Press Play - everything auto-spawns (ground, player, enemies, walls)
4. **Controls**: WASD/Left Stick (move), Space/B (roll), Left Click/X (attack)
5. **Debug Info**: Press F1 to toggle stats overlay
6. **Camera**: Diablo-style fixed-angle automatically follows player

**What Auto-Generates:**
- Green ground plane (20x20 units)
- Blue capsule player with CharacterController
- Red cube enemies for combat testing
- Gray boundary walls
- Camera positioned at optimal Diablo-style angle

**Perfect for:**
- Testing movement feel and responsiveness
- Iterating on combat mechanics
- Adjusting camera angles and follow behavior
- Controller input validation
- Performance testing with multiple enemies

You can now open Unity, create a new URP project, and copy these files in to get started immediately!

## üìã Next Development Steps

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Core Combat & Camera Systems
**Prototype Framework:**
- Unity project structure with all core scripts
- TestScene.unity with auto-setup system
- Ready for immediate Unity testing

**Combat System (COMPLETE):**
- Responsive player movement with WASD controls
- Attack system with timing, range visualization, and effects
- Rolling/dodge mechanics with stamina management
- Enemy AI with health, damage, and knockback
- Visual feedback: hit effects, damage effects, attack cones
- Sound placeholder system for all actions

**Camera System (COMPLETE):**
- Diablo-style fixed-angle camera (40¬∞ angle)
- Smooth player following with configurable speed
